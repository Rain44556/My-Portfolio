The Star Section component is simple and elegant, designed to highlight a hero section with a call to action that encourages users to scroll and place an order. There's a unique coffee category section showcasing different types of coffee. For animations, Iâ€™ve implemented React Reveal, creating beautiful effects throughout the site. The Items component is well-structured and displays a variety of drinks, meals, and desserts. It features category-based filtering, animations using React Reveal, and utilizes JSON data for dynamic rendering. My Place component is also well-organized, allowing users to switch between location images dynamically. Lastly, I added a beautiful and simple footer to complete the website.",
